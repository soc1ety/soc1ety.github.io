Hey, society here. I've been interested in the security field for about 4 years now, I'm currently working part-time as a security engineer while developing my skills through various projects or stuff I find myself enjoying doing in my spare time.  

My heart belongs to red team funsies, more particularly to malware development and offensive tooling in general.  

I'm aiming to write more and share what I enjoy exploring, which is the purpose of this blog.  

If you would like to discuss something or share ideas you can find me on twitter => @societynotreal
